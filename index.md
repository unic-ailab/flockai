# Welcome to the FlockAI project website!

The aim of the FlockAI project is to deliver a framework capable of enabling Machine Learning and its applications to drone technology for handling time-critical missions (e.g., search and rescue missions). Specifically, FlockAI will advance the current research plain by developing innovative AI-enabled self-adaptive algorithms to ease energy consumption and improve data delivery timeliness in drone swarms. To achieve these goals, the FlockAI project will explore the use of various power-efficient machine learning models for dynamically adjusting, in place, the data sensing and routing of data over drone swarms while maintaining mission requirements. The methods delivered by the project will be placed in a modular and reusable framework for drone swarm operation.

## Project Objectives

- **The FlockAI benchmark suite**. An open benchmarking framework that enables drone technology researchers and data scientists to rapidly deploy, test and evaluate AI algorithms.

- **Self-adaptive sensing for drones**. Design a novel algorithmic process that dynamically adjusts the sensing intensity of multi-variate data streams collected by drones through low-cost estimation models to capture the runtime evolution and variability of the data.

- **Decentralized data routing for drone swarms**. Design a novel routing mechanism that can be integrated with the communication interfaces of drones to support multi-hop routing over geo-distributed drone swarms.

## Current Work
The FlockAI research team is currently working on designing and developing a framework that will enable researchers to rapidly test advanced AI models for drone technology. Users of our benchmarking framework will be able to rapidly provision -reproducable- emulated testbeds for AI experimentation without the need of knowing complex internals of drone technology or emulation frameworks. 

Stay tuned for the first release of our benchmarking suite that will run on top of the open and popular webots emulator!
